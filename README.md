Iris Classification Model

Overview

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification model using the Iris dataset. The model is built using Python and the scikit-learn library, specifically utilizing a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset is commonly used for testing and demonstrating machine learning algorithms.

Features

Load and visualize the Iris dataset.
Train a Decision Tree Classifier on the dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualize the decision tree.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Installation

Clone or Download the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the Script: Save the code provided in iris_classifier.py, then execute:
bash
Copy code
python iris_classifier.py
Usage

Upon running the script, the following will happen:

The Iris dataset will be loaded.
A pairplot will visualize the relationships between features.
The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier will be trained.
Predictions will be made on the test set.
The accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report will be printed.
The trained decision tree will be visualized.
Example Output

The accuracy of the model will be displayed.
A confusion matrix and a classification report will provide detailed performance metrics.
A visual representation of the decision tree will be shown.
Enhancements

Feel free to enhance the project by:

Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines).
Implementing hyperparameter tuning.
Adding cross-validation for better model evaluation.
